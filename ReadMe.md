# HsMod

 **H**earth**s**tone **Mod**ification Based on BepInEx Hearthstone modification based on BepInEx, the plugin source code is located at [github](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod)[.](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod)[com](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod)[/](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod)[Pik](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod)[-](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod)[4](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod)[/](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod)[HsMod](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod), the plugin will not collect any information about you; the project follows `AGPL-3.0`, and is used for learning and research only.

**Warning: The Hearthstone client in mainland China starts the anti-cheat SDK by default, and the plugin will try to block the relevant anti-cheat functions, but it cannot guarantee the safety of your account.**

The readme was translated by DeepL, please forgive any grammatical errors. **Currently the mod only supports [Simplified Chinese](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod/blob/bepinex5/[CHS]ReadMe.md)**

Note: unity and mono for Windows, extracted from [unity editor](https://unity.com/ja/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.40), unity is located at `.\Unity 2021.3.40f1\Editor\Data\PlaybackEngines\windowsstandalonesupport\Variations\win32_player_development_mono\Data\Managed`, mono Located in `.\Unity 2021.3.40f1\Editor\Data\MonoBleedingEdge\lib\mono\unityjit-win32`, some of the files are located in `unityjit-win32\Facades` )

#### Mac

1. Download the latest version of [BepInEx_unix](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract it to `Hearthstone/`

2. ~~Download original [Mono](https://unity.bepinex.dev/corlibs/2021.3.40.zip) and [Unity](https://unity.bepinex.dev/libraries/2021.3.40.zip) libraries and unpack to Hearthstone/BepInEx/unstripped_corlib~~. Copy all `dll` which under the project folder `HsMod/LibUnityMonoUnix` (`cp HsMod/LibUnityMonoUnix/*  Hearthstone/BepInEx/unstripped_corlib/` ). ( PS. Mono and Unity version must same as Hearthstone ).

3. Edit the `run_bepinex.sh` file replacing the line `export DOORSTOP_CORLIB_OVERRIDE_PATH=""`with `DOORSTOP_CORLIB_OVERRIDE_PATH="$BASEDIR/BepInEx/unstripped_corlib"`

4. Edit the file `run_bepinex.sh` replacing the line `executable_name=""` with `executable_name="Hearthstone.app"`

5. Run command in console `chmod u+x run_bepinex.sh`

6. Get the [token](https://www.battlenet.com.cn/login/zh-cn/?app=wtcg) here and copy after `http://localhost:0/?ST=` and before `&accountId=`

   ```
   # Some verify url
   https://www.battlenet.com.cn/login/zh-cn/?app=wtcg
   https://us.battle.net/login/en/?app=wtcg
   https://tw.battle.net/login/zh/?app=wtcg
   https://kr.battle.net/login/zh/?app=wtcg
   https://eu.battle.net/login/zh/?app=wtcg
   ...
   ```

7. Create a `client.config` file with the following content, instead of `token` - insert the token obtained in the previous step. Env value `xx.actual.battle.net`(parameter for China is `cn.actual.battlenet.com.cn`); `xx` same as the token first two characters. E.g

   ```
   [Config]
   Version = 3
   [Aurora]
   VerifyWebCredentials = "token"
   ClientCheck = 0
   Env.Override = 1
   Env = us.actual.battle.net
   ```

9. Download the [BepInExConfigManager.Mono](https://github.com/sinai-dev/BepInExConfigManager/releases) and unzip to `Hearthstone/BepInEx`After entering the game, press `F5` to control HsMod.

Now the game needs to be launched only through `./run_bepinex.sh`

If the token becomes obsolete and the game stops opening, then you just need to update it in the `client.config`.

The first run on Mac may prompt a Battle.net login error, please find HsMod.cfg and modify the activation plugin, please refer to [#](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod/issues/8#issuecomment-1344470389)[8](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod/issues/8#issuecomment-1344470389) for details.

#### **Linux** 

1. Compile `HsMod` or download `HsMod.dll` from `Releases`.

2. Install Hearthstone for Linux by referring to [0xf4b1/hearthstone-linux](https://github.com/0xf4b1/hearthstone-linux). (Theoretically, client.config will be configured at this point)

3. Download [BepInEx_unix](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) (note: currently using BepInEx5) and extract it to the Hearthstone root directory under `hearthstone/`.

4. Create a directory `hearthstone/BepInEx/unstripped_corlib/`;

5. Note: You can also copy all the `.dlls` under the project directory `HsMod/LibUnityMonoUnix` directly to that directory

6. 1. Download [Mono](https://unity.bepinex.dev/corlibs/2021.3.40.zip) and [Unity](https://unity.bepinex.dev/libraries/2021.3.40.zip), unzip and extract the dlls, copy all dlls to the directory under that directory.

      ```
      cp HsMod/LibUnityMonoUnix/UniTask* hearthstone/BepInEx/unstripped_corlib/
      ```

7. Modify `unix_bepinex.sh`

8. 1. Replace `export DOORSTOP_CORLIB_OVERRIDE_PATH="" `with` DOORSTOP_CORLIB_OVERRIDE_PATH="$BASEDIR/BepInEx/unstripped_corlib"`
   2. Replace `executable_name=""` with `executable_name="Bin/Hearthstone.x86_64"`
   3. Once the replacement is complete, run `sed -i "s/\r/ /g" ./run_bepinex.sh` to modify the line breaks at the end of the file to match the Linux filesystem.

9. If configured correctly, the directory structure should look like the following at this point.

10. 

    ```
    hsmod@hsmod:~/hearthstone-linux/hearthstone$ ls -alh
    drwxrwxr-x 9 a a 4.0K Jan 12 12:07 .

    -rw-rw-r-- 1 a a   21 Jan 12 10:47 .version
    ```

11. If `client.config` is not configured, refer to steps 6-7 in the macOS installation instructions to configure client.config

12. Store `HsMod.dll` in the `hearthstone/BepInEx/plugins` directory (if the plugins directory does not exist, you need to create it manually).

13. Install the BepInEx [ConfigManager BepInExConfigManager.Mono](https://github.com/sinai-dev/BepInExConfigManager/releases) and unzip it to `hearthstone/BepInEx/`; enter the game and `F5` for the relevant controls.

14. Give `run_bepinex.sh` execute permission.

    ```
    chmod u+x run_bepinex.sh
    ```

15. Execute `./run_bepinex.sh` and enjoy Hearthstone.

### Version Description

As in HsMod version `3.0.0.0`:

First 3 => Hearthstone major version. For example: 3 => 26

The second digit 0 => the number of times Hearthstone has been updated in that version, which does not correspond to Hearthstone minor versions; furthermore, this number is not updated when an update to Hearthstone occurs, but there are no changes to files such as `Assembly-CSharp.dll`. For example: 0 => 26.x.y.z

Third bit 0 => This number is +1 when HsMod has new features for that Hearthstone version; this number is set to zero when the second bit changes.

Fourth bit 0 => compile version. Mainly records the number of bug fixes, corresponding to the third bit.

Hearthstone version update does not necessarily cause HsMod to fail, if HsMod plugin functions normally, it can not be updated with Release.HsMod update features can refer to the commit record.

### **Additional Notes** 

1. The plugin may not be placed in a directory containing Chinese characters, i.e. the Hearthstone installation path cannot contain Chinese characters.
2. This plugin may conflict with modifications based on `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, modifying `Assembly-CSharp.dll` may lead to abnormal positioning of IL commands, which in turn may cause the relevant Patch can not take effect; it may also conflict with other BepInEx plug-ins (such as mercenaries, MixMod), the reason is that the same method may exist in both plug-ins. The reason is that the same method may exist in two plugins, and when there are more than one Patch, the running result may be abnormal, and this plugin doesn't detect whether the original method has been modified or not.
3. The configuration file for skins is in `Hearthstone\BepInEx\config\HsSkins.cfg`. If there is none, it will be created automatically after running the game.
4. `F4` is a fixed shortcut key used to get some in-game information (related information is stored in the `Hearthstone\BepInEx\` directory), **update the skin configuration**, restart the web service, etc. The rest of the shortcuts can be customized and configured.
5. By default, almost all features of the plugin need to be enabled manually; most of the plugin's features can be found in the configuration, while a few are only mentioned in the Patch (such as minimizing restrictions).
6. The default port of this plug-in Web Server (i.e. Showinfo) is 58744, in general, listening to all local IPs, when using cloud servers, please pay attention to the configuration of firewalls, security groups and so on.
7. The log file used for logging statistics is `BepInEx\HsMatch.log`, which can be modified in the settings. (Fields are ` separated` by `,`)
8. When a problem occurs first try to delete the relevant `.cfg` configuration file (usually located in `BepInEx\config\` ) and reconfigure; if the problem still exists, please bring `HsMod.cfg` to submit [Issues](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod/issues), but there is no guarantee of a timely answer.
9. `GetHsLib.py` is used to update Hearthstone's own runtime libraries, and `install.bat` is used to copy the compiled `HsMod.dll` to the default Hearthstone directory (provided BepInEx has been configured). In addition, after push changes the version number (after PluginInfo.cs changes), [a release](https://github.com/Pik-4/HsMod/releases) is automatically generated.
10. If the skin display is abnormal, please check `HsSkins.cfg` and try to delete `HsMod.cfg` to re-configure it.
11. If the modified settings can not be saved, please check if other Hearthstone plugins are enabled.
12. For BepInEx, please choose **BepInEx 5**. Since BepInEx 6 is still in pre-release, it will not be adapted for now.

### client.config

 `client.config` is used to launch Hearthstone bypassing Battle.net, the file is located in the folder where Hearthstone.exe is located and has the following contents.

```config
[Config]
Version = 3
[Aurora]
VerifyWebCredentials = "VerifyWebCredentials"
ClientCheck = 0
Env.Override = 1
Env = us.actual.battle.net
```

 Some token acquisition links

```url
https://account.battlenet.com.cn/login/zh-cn/?app=wtcg
https://tw.battle.net/login/zh/?app=wtcg
https://kr.battle.net/login/zh/?app=wtcg
https://us.battle.net/login/en/?app=wtcg
https://eu.battle.net/login/en/?app=wtcg
```

With the plugin enabled, the support `./Hearthstone.exe VerifyWebCredentials` command to launch Hearthstone ( ~~but required a client.config file~~, which is now not needed!) .

Note: The `Env` parameter for China is `cn.actual.battlenet.com.cn`.

### TODO 

1. Organize ReadMe, update Wiki, etc.; Organize the relationship between Configuration and Patch; Multi-language support
2. In-game one-click hero skin change, currently can only be updated by simulating dropouts
3. Refactor Showinfo related web pages.
4. Adapt to Mac
5. Fix mercenary related functions
